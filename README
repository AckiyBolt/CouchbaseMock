Hi!

CouchbaseMock is a super-scaled down test server to use for testing
of "smart clients" for Couchbase.

I've tried to keep the dependency list as short as possible and rather
implement the basic functionality I need instead of adding dependencies to
another library (and have to look at the license for the library etc)

Cheers,

Trond Norbye
