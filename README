Hi!

JMembase is a super-scaled down test server I'm going to be using to test
libmembase. It is not designed to be used in production environments, only
to verify that libmembase works as intended.

I've tried to keep the dependency list as short as possible and rather
implement the basic functionality I need instead of adding dependencies to
another library (and have to look at the license for the library etc)

Cheers,

Trond Norbye
